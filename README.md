# Project overview
- This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures in C++ and their applications in real-world systems. The goal is to understand how data structures work, where they are applied, and how algorithms operate on them efficiently.

- ## Key Features
- Demonstrates core data structures (Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph)
- Provides examples of real-world applications for each data structure
- Includes a research report explaining algorithms and system integration
- Screenshots of program outputs for clarity

## Implemented Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph

## How to Run the Code
1. Navigate to the `src` folder.
2. Compile a file using g++:

    bash
   g++ array.cpp -o array
   ./array
- Replace array.cpp with the file you want to run. eg, stack.cpp
- The codes are commented for ease of understanding.
